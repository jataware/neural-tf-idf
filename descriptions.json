For a single MODIS tile, the change-detection algorithm 1) produces composite imagery that summarizes persistent changes in the time series of a burn-sensitive vegetation index, 2) uses spatial and temporal active-fire information to guide the statistical characterization of burn-related and non-burn-related change, and 3) estimates a probabilistic threshold to identify grid cells containing burned areas. One month of daily observations before and after the mapping period are required to accommodate the moving windows employed in the change-detection process, so three consecutive months of observations are required to map one calendar month of burning. In addition to detecting the burned area extent, the data product also approximates the day of burning in each month for each 500-m grid cell based on active fire detections.\r\n\r\nCitation\r\nGiglio, L. et al.

The data-driven models employed for the surge reconstruction were developed by Tadesse et al. (2020). We use five different atmospheric reanalysis products with different spatial and temporal resolution to produce surge information for the periods covered by the different reanalyses. Concerning instrumental data, all available tide gauges from the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC, http://uhslc. soest.hawaii.edu/data/download/rq) were downloaded at hourly scale. From the total amount of 643 tide gauges, only those with more than one year of data before 2010 are used to validate the reconstructed surge from 20CR. In order to compare both signals, the tide gauge residuals are obtained by subtracting the astronomical tide (computed using t-tide, Pawlowicz et al., 2002) to the hourly values, and subtracting a 30-day moving average to both, modelled and measured data. This leads to a validation of the storm surge reconstruction at 386 tide gauge locations distributed worldwide.

Ports are grouped according to country and locality, and are listed in geographic sequence as shown on the chartlets in the fore part of the volume, following, in general, the coastal trend. The listing of ports in off-lying islands normally interrupts the coastal listing at some convenient place abreast of the island. River ports are listed toward the head of navigation, alternating from bank to bank, except where local considerations make other arrangements more practicable.\r\nIn general, ports are listed under the names approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Alternate or more familiar names, however, are also included in the index, under the same index number.

Main activity producers (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned.

(2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process.

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property. A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official export credits, official sector equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization undertaken by the official sector at nonconcessional terms (irrespective of the nature or the identity of the original creditor).
